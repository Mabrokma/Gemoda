    This a brief write--up of my work on a new pattern discovery
    algorithm, which I currently refer to as ``shiva'' for no
    good reason.  The purpose of this paper is to formalize the
    math underlying the algorithm and to provide a few concrete
    examples of the algorithm in action.  Also, this is the first
    time I've tried to put these concepts onto paper, so it may
    be a bit rough.  Essentially, shiva is a
    generic algorithm, or maybe better, a framework, for finding
    patterns in stochastic data.  In the context of biosequences,
    using a Blast--like alignment metric of similarity, shiva 
    answers the following question: ``What is the set of all possible
    multiple sequence alignments over a given E--value threshold.''
